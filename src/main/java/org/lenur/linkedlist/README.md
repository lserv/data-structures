- Time complexity is O(1) for operations(deleting, updating) from the end and begins of the list.
- Time complexity is O(n) for operations(deleting, updating) from the middle of the list.
- Time complexity is O(n) for getting an element by an index and by value from the list.
- It can be used like a queue, stack with time complexity O(1).
